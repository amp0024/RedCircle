COCG WordPress Starter Theme
============================

Use this theme to kick-start your WordPress theme development. Uses [SASS](http://www.sass-lang.org/) with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) installed.

This is a very empty theme, with only basic blocks set. The CSS should include WordPress default styles, and begins with the HTML5 Boilerplate reset. It also has a CodeKit project file, if you use that app.

Install
-------

Drop into your /wp-content/themes folder, and rename the folder as you wish. Develop as you choose.
