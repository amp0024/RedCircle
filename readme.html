<h1>COCG WordPress Starter Theme</h1>

<p>Use this theme to kick-start your WordPress theme development. Uses <a href="http://www.sass-lang.org/">SASS</a> with <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a> installed.</p>

<p>This is a very empty theme, with only basic blocks set. The CSS should include WordPress default styles, and begins with the HTML5 Boilerplate reset. It also has a CodeKit project file, if you use that app.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>Drop into your /wp-content/themes folder, and rename the folder as you wish. Develop as you choose.</p>
